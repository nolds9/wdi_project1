## Overview:

Looks great.  I've added the show to my playlist.  
You coded a working game after only two weeks of coding.  That's pretty cool.

Your readme, files, and code are well organized.  You executed well and didn't reach too far.  I'd like to see some code extracted into functions next time.

Keep up the good work.

## Rubric:

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

    **3: Exceeds Expectations**. Nice readme!  Well organized.  Sharing your process and thoughts is great.

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

    **2: Meets Expectations** I'm leaning towards exceeds here, because it's just so clean.  A functional game in 45 lines?  Pretty cool.  But, I went with "Meets" ecause it's not clear how you've pushed yourself.  

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

    **2: Meets expectations** I'm sure you had some fun with the questions.  The game play and graphics are simple and clear.

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

    **2: Meet expectations** Nice and clean.  Review my code comments in this [Pull Request](https://github.com/nolds9/wdi_project1/pull/1) (prefixed with my initials - "mms").

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations? _(Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've completed the project.)_

    **3: Exceeds expectations** To be able to struggle and pivot midway, but still pull out a working application is a mean feat.  Congrats.

Good job.  Keep it up.  You'll be hired in no time.
